A great deal of agricultural research was conducted, which resulted in the production of artificial
fertilisers, which are now a basic requirement for all agricultural activities. Agricultural education
is now taught in schools across the country. Scientists have gone so far as to study the genomic
makeup of plants to select crops that can withstand harsh climate changes. Improved farming
techniques have been developed using new technologies such as computer science and
biotechnology. Science has played an important role in agriculture, and the two cannot be

separated. Science must be used to help produce better yields on a small piece of land for the
world to be able to provide enough food for all of its citizens.
