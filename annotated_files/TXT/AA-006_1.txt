You can't see or touch stress, but you can feel its effects on your mind and body. In the short
term, stress quickens your heart rate and breathing and increases your blood pressure. When
you're constantly under stress, your adrenal giands overproduce the hormone cortisol.
Overexposure to this hormone can affect the function of your brain, Immune system, and other
organs. Chronic stress can contribute to headaches, anxiety, depression, heart disease, and
even premature death. Though you may not be able to eradicate the roots of stress, you can
minimize its effects on your body. One of the easiest and most achievable stress-relieving
techniques is meditation, a program in which you focus your attention inward to induce a state of
deep relaxation.
