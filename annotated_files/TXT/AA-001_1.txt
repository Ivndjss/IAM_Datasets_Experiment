A complex sentence is a sentence with one independent clause and at least one dependent
clause. It works best when you need to provide more information to explain or modify your
sentence’s main point. Complex sentences are easy to spot as they often use subordinating
conjunctions like because, since, or until to connect clauses. Complex sentences are one of the
four types of sentences based on structure (simple, complex, compound, and compound-
complex). Their distinction is that they contain a dependent clause; only complex sentences and
complex-compound sentences have these. A dependent clause, also known as a subordinate
clause, is a clause that cannot stand alone as a complete sentence. Without an independent
clause, a dependent clause is just a sentence fragment.
