“INSTRUCTIONS!” Rewrite the given paragraph below on the space given after
the paragraph.

The period of time when the scientists of Europe first started using electricity to create powerful
engines and high functioning mechanisms gave a push to such processes as industrialization,
urbanization, and globalization; it made a massive impact on the world’s society, its way of living,
and habits, it produced massive cultural, political and economic changes. There is a common
misconception that electricity actually may be an invention, but it is one of the natural forms of
energy, it has always existed on our planet so it could not possibly be ‘invented”. The most
influential and powerful invention was the discovery of electricity and of ways of using it for
various technologies. Historically, some of the first encounters humans made with electricity date
back to Ancient Greece, when people first discovered the rubbing fur and amber together created
the attraction between the two surfaces and also lighter objects, which occurred due to static
electricity (Atkinson, 2014). This cannot be called a discovery because the reasons or practical

use of this phenomenon were not understood.
