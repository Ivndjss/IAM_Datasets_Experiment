“INSTRUCTIONSI!” Rewrite the given paragraph below on the space given after

the paragraph.
Philosophy is a branch of human inquiry and as such it aims at knowledge and understanding.
We might expect that the value of philosophy lies in the value of the ends that it seeks, the
knowledge and understanding it reveals. But philosophy is rather notorious for failing to establish
definitive knowledge on the matters it investigates. I'm not so sure this reputation is well
deserved. We do learn much from doing philosophy. Philosophy often clearly reveals why some
initially attractive answers to big philosophical questions are deeply problematic, for instance. But
granted, philosophy often frustrates our craving for straightforward convictions. In our first
reading, Bertrand Russell argues that there is great value in doing philosophy precisely because
it frustrates our desire for quick easy answers. In denying us easy answers to big questions and
undermining complacent convictions, philosophy liberates us from narrow minded conventional
thinking and opens our minds to new possibilities. Philosophy often provides an antidote to
prejudice not by settling big questions, but by revealing just how hard it is to settle those

questions. It can lead us to question our comfortably complacent conventional opinions.
